Project Title:

Smart SDLC ‚Äì AI-Enhanced Software Development Life Cycle


---

üìå Project Overview:

Smart SDLC is a next-generation software development approach that integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) into each phase of the traditional SDLC. 
The goal is to automate repetitive tasks, improve accuracy, and accelerate development by using AI-powered tools and models like IBM Granite.

üîÅ AI-Enhanced SDLC Phases:

1. Requirement Gathering:

AI chatbots analyze and convert user input into structured requirements.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used for requirement extraction.



2. Planning:

AI estimates time, cost, and resources.

Risk analysis using machine learning models.



3. Design:

Auto-generation of system architecture diagrams (UML, ER).

AI tools help in user interface mockup generation.



4. Development:

Code suggestions using IBM Granite AI or GitHub Copilot.

Smart error detection, code optimization, and auto-documentation.



5. Testing:

AI auto-generates unit and integration test cases.

Smart bug detection, test coverage analysis, and defect prediction.



6. Deployment:

Continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

AI-based monitoring of performance, usage, and error logs.



7. Maintenance:

Predictive maintenance using machine learning.

Real-time feedback analysis and automated bug fixes.
