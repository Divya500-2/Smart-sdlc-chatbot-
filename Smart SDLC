What is smart sdlc?

**Smart SDLC is a modern,
AI-integrated approach to the traditional Software Development Life Cycle. 
It combines automation, intelligence, and 
agile methods to make software development faster, 
smarter, and more efficient.**

Phases of Smart SDLC (with Enhancements):

1. Requirement Gathering (AI-Aided):

    Uses NLP tools or chatbots to understand client needs.

    Auto-generates requirement documents or user stories.



2. Planning (Smart Analytics):

    Estimates cost, time, and risk using data-driven tools.

    Agile sprint planning with intelligent suggestions.



3. Design (AI + Automation):

    Auto-generate wireframes or UML diagrams using tools like AI design assistants.



4. Development (Code Intelligence):

    Smart code suggestions using models like IBM Granite, Copilot, etc.

    Code auto-completion, bug detection, and best-practice enforcement.



5. Testing (Automated + AI Testing):

    Auto-generate test cases from requirements.

    AI-powered test coverage analysis and bug prediction.



6. Deployment (CI/CD + Smart Monitoring):

    Continuous deployment using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions.

    AI-based performance monitoring and issue alerts.



7. Maintenance (Self-Healing + Feedback Loops):

   Uses ML to predict issues before they happen.

   Auto-updates, user feedback collection, and adaptation.
